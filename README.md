# Etsy-ish: an app by Sage Kolpin, Maha Mamoor, and Tim Minker

# Technologies used:
 - For the backend, Django and PostgreSQL(among others) were used to create a single-page application.

# Approach taken:
 - Initial idea was to re-create the Etsy site, to allow users to create items for sale, edit the items, add them to a cart (and remove them if needed), and then finally check out with their selected items.

# Unsolved problems:

# User stories:
 - Can login or create account on site.
 - Can add, edit, and remove items to the central database.
 - Can add items to be purchased to their cart.
 - Can remove items from cart or delete entire cart.
 - Can checkout with desired items and place order.
 - Can view chart of company financials.
